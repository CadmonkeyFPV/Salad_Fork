# Salad Fork Fork
Independent work on the Salad Fork concept as I prototype my own based on the in-process work of Yeri
* Gantry Isolated
* B Idler Created
* Imported Micron X Axis
* Corrected X Axis Alignment
* Belts Extended to 120mm bed lengths
* Gantry Belt Path Alignment Tweaked
* Added SaladFork Logo to Toolhead & Idlers
* Extended MGN9 rail to 190mm & cut recesses into XY joints for joints to act as full stoppers
## ToDo
* Revise extrusion profiles to MakerBeam (that's what I've ordered)
* Extend extrusions 30mm each for my 150mm<sup>2</sup> build size
* Tweak STLs to fit MakerBeam profiles
* More as I progress on my proto build for sure
