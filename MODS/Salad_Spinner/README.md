# The Salad Spinner Spool Holder

Horizontal Spool Holder designed for the Salad Fork project but adaptable to many other printers.

Intended to mount to top panel of printer. Stand alone turntable for use on other platforms.

Threaded clamps for 1kg and 5 pound spools (5 pound version has only been tested on KVP 5 pound spool at this time)

Photos to come after Christmas.

Turntable gets mounted to top panel of printer. Rectangular boss achors to rear of printer and riser couples that to extrusion using M3x12 BHCS and preloaded hex nut. Adjust riser Z dimension in slicer to accomodate different panel and foam combinations, STL as provided works with 3mm panel, 6mm foam compressed to 5mm. The front ear on the turntable requires the top panel to be drilled to accept an M3, and the Bowden guide (with heat set installed) mounts to the interior of the printer on this bolt. Guide loosely secures the Bowden mid span. You will need to experiment with overall bowden length to determine was works best for your toolhead and other accessories/mods. I have enough Bowden to extend 4" past the front panel when stretched out, which coils down to the Orbiter I am running.

Standalone Turntable uses (3) M3 BHCS sized to work with your panel thickness.

Spinner core gets M5 heat set inserts in each leg. Follow that with a flat washer or shim against the body, one bearing and finally secure with an M5x12 BHCS. Repeat 2 more times for each leg.

Corner Clip Bowden support mounts replaces the top panel corner mount and supports the spool end of the reverse Bowden tube at approx middle of the spool. Bowden is a tight fit, use a rat tail file if you need to open up bore to get the tube in place. There is a bend in the bore to help hold this tight.
