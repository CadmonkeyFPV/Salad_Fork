# Fan Supports with M3 Screw Tabs

Upgraded fan support for the Salad Fork project. 

Provides tabs to screw the 4010 electronics bay fans in place. M3 SHCS threads into the plastic, no heat set required.

## BOM

- (6) M3x12 SHCS
- (2) 4010 Fans (I prefer Noctua for whisper quiet silence)
- (1) M3x6 BHCS (to mount to extrusion if you don't already have)
- (1) M3 Hex Nut (ditto)

Press firmly as you thread the screws in so they form some amount of thread instead of just cutting plastic out of the way.

I added (2) additional M3x12 w/ hexnuts in the unsupported corner just for aesthetics. They aren't required though.
